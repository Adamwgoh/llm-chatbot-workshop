Dear ying, thank you for the beautiful meetup today, visiting your dad's house, having coffee at Hougang Mall and watching a movie 'I am the Secret in your Heart' at NEX. We also agreed on the below today:
1 Not to cut each other off on our IGs and FB.
2 Need to text each other everyday regularly to checkin and maintain contact. To acknowledge each others' texts.
3 Need to update each other on our programme for the day or next day without the other party asking.
4 Try to meet up at least twice a week regardless of the duration.

Ok bo?
